# Project Postmortem
This doesn't feel finished. Looking at our initial small base goals, our game currently meets the minimum playable product with quite a few strech 
goals tacked on. I don't think we can call this a finished game though. I do think that we did really well in getting here, considering the 40% drop 
in group members, but there is no feel of closure at milestone 4. I (Jonathan) had a quick discussion about continuing work on this game after the 
class, considering that it could go in our portfolios. I think what we have can turn into something that goods pretty good, we just need to give it some 
time. I do understand that the premice of working on a group project for a class that you have completed may not seem appealing to some, and so it would 
make sense if progress after the class doesn't happen, or comes really slowly, but I would like to keep working on this. I think with more time, we can 
accopmlish what could be done if we had more people. This doesn't have as much of a reward considering work after the class won't improve our grades or 
give us credits, but I think that if making a cool game is in itself a reward for the work, then its a good sign that we will enjoy classes to come in this 
program.
